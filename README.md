# Udacity FSND Capstone

The casting agency project. it's the capstone project of Udacity to demonstrate the fullstack skills that students get during the nano-degree.
The back-end service in this project, is based on Role-Based Authentication and Authorization, so for the user to access the services, he/she need to have an account with privligies.

to build this project, I have used, 
- Python and Flask to build the backend-server
- Auth0 as third-party for Authentication and Authorization process.
- Heroku to deploy the application on using github as pipeline. 

## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies

To start the project locally, you need to have the following tools:
- Python3 and pip or pip3

#### Python 3.7

Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

#### Virtual Enviornment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the root of the directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

install all packages in the `requirements.txt` file.

##### Key Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 


## Running the server locally in development environment

in the `root` of the project directory.

To run the server:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
source setup.sh
python app.py
```

the `source setup.sh` contain all environment variables.

NOTE: you need to make changes to the `setup.sh` file, if you would like to run it locally. 

#### Testing

for tests, run:
```
dropdb capstonefsnd_test
createdb capstonefsnd_test
source setup.sh
python test_app.py
```

## Authentication and Priviligies

Authentication is handled via [Auth0](https://auth0.com).

For testing, use the Tokens available in the setup.bash file.

API endpoints use these roles and priviligies:

- Casting Assistant:
    * 'get:movies' (get all the movies that available)
    * 'get:actors' (get all the actors that available)

- Casting Director:
    * Same as the Casting Assistant priviligies, and
    * 'delete:actor' (delete actor agency casting database).
    * 'patch:actor' (update actor data in the casting agency database).
    * 'patch:movie' (update actor data in the casting agency database).
    * 'post:actors' (create new actors record in the casting agency database).

- Executive Producer:
    * Same as the Casting Director priviligies, and
    * 'delete:movie' (remove movie from the casting agency database).
    * 'post:movies' (create new movies in the casting agency database).
